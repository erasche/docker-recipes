# Redeclipse 1.5.3 server

I stupidly decided to build from source... until I spent half an hour
fighting with why the built server was supposedly running a very different
version than was in the src tree. Surprise of surprises, redeclipse
downloads a server binary from the redeclipse people, which doesn't even
require libsdl!

## TODO

- [ ] wget http://redeclipse.net/files/stable/linux.tar.gz
- [ ] back to alpine wheeee
- [ ] just clone the submodules for "data" folder
- [ ] config folder
